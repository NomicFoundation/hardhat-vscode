# Hardhat for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds language support for [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) to Visual Studio Code, and provides editor integration for [Hardhat projects](https://hardhat.org/). Integrations for other tools are coming in the near future. It supports:

- Code completion
- Go to definition, type definition and references
- Symbol renames
- Solidity code formatting through [prettier-plugin-solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity)
- Inline code validation from compiler errors/warnings for Hardhat projects
- Hover help for variables, function calls, errors, events etc.
- Code actions (quickfixes) suggested from compiler errors/warnings for Hardhat projects
  - Implement missing functions on interface with stubs
  - Constrain mutability by adding `view`/`pure` to function signature
  - Meet inheritance requirements by adding `virtual`/`override` on function signature
  - Provide accessibility by adding `public`/`private` to function signature

Built by the [Nomic Foundation](https://nomic.foundation/). [Weâ€™re hiring](https://nomic.foundation/hiring).

## Installation

**Hardhat for Visual Studio Code** can be installed by [using the Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity).

Some features (e.g. inline validation) are still experimental and are only enabled within a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project, this is a limitation that will be lifted with future releases.

## Setup

This extension should work without any configuration. If formatting functionality isn't working, or you have previously configured another **Solidity** formatter, please read on.

### Formatting

**Hardhat for Visual Studio Code** provides formatting support for `.sol` files, by leveraging [prettier-plugin-solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity).

> **Note:** if you currently have other solidity extensions installed, or have had previously, they may be set as your default formatter for solidity files.

To set **Hardhat for Visual Studio Code** as your default formatter for solidity files:

1. Within a Solidity file run the _Format Document With_ command, either through the **command palette**, or by right clicking and selecting through the context menu:

![Format Document With](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode/docs/add-formatting-instructions/docs/images/format_document_with.png "Format Document With")

2. Select `Configure Default Formatter...`

3. Select `Hardhat + Solidity` as the default formatter for solidity files

#### Formatting Configuration

The default formatting rules that will be applied are taken from [prettier-plugin-solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity#configuration-file), with the exception that `explicitTypes` are preserved (rather than forced).

To override the settings, add a `prettierrc` configuration file at the root of your project. Add a `*.sol` file override to the prettier configuration file and change from the **defaults** shown:

```javascript
// .prettierrc.json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "*.sol",
      "options": {
        "printWidth": 80,
        "tabWidth": 4,
        "useTabs": false,
        "singleQuote": false,
        "bracketSpacing": false,
        "explicitTypes": "preserve"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
