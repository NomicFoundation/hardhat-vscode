# Welcome to the Hardhat VSCode beta!

Thanks for helping us improve the extension before its initial release.

We are looking to learn more from your experience using the extension, so please let us know about any errors, missing features that other extensions have, or even features that you haven't seen anywhere else.

Please read this document before starting to use the extension

## Setting up the extension

The extension should work without any kind of configuration, just make sure you disabled any other Solidity extension to avoid unwanted interactions.

## Sharing your feedback

If you want to report an issue, suggest an improvement, ask a question about the extension, or request a new feature, please open an issue in [this repository](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-vscode-feedback).

Including clear instructions to reproduce your issue and example code (preferably a link to a repository) would be much appreciated.

## Inviting other people to the beta

Please, don't share the link to the extension as it's not ready to be launched.

If you want to share it with someone, let us know about it in [this issue](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat-vscode-feedback/issues/9) and we'll move them to the front of the waitlist. We'll invite them as soon as we know we can process more feedback.
