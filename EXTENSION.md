## Installation

**Hardhat for Visual Studio Code** can be installed by searching for `hardhat` within the `visual studio code` extension tab or via the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).

Some features (e.g. inline validation) are still experimental and are only enabled within a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project, this is a limitation that will be lifted with future releases.
