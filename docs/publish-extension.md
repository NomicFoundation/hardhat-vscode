# Instructions on how to publish extension

To publish `hardhat-solidity` you need to do next steps:

1.  `git fetch`, Checkout out `development`, then ensure your branch is up to date `git pull --ff-only`
2.  Perform a clean install and build (will lose all uncommitted changes):

    ```sh
    git clean -fdx .
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

3.  Run a full check, stopping on failure: `npm run fullcheck`, optionally you can check that each commit meets our build requirements with: `git rebase main --exec "npm install && npm run fullcheck"`
4.  Confirm the commits represent the features for the release
5.  Branch into a release branch named for the current date: `git checkout -b release/yyyy-mm-dd`
6.  Update the version based on semver, ensure it is updated in:

    - The client package version in `./client/package.json`
    - The language server package version in `./server/package.json`
    - The coc extension package version in `./coc/package.json`
      - Its `@nomicfoundation/solidity-language-server` dependency version.

7.  Update the changelog in `./client/CHANGELOG.md` by adding a new entry for the new version based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
8.  Commit the package version and changelog change as a version bump commit:

    ```git
    chore: bump version to v0.x.x

    Update the package version and changelog for the `0.x.x - yyyy-mm-dd`
    release.
    ```

9.  Push the release branch and open a pull request against `main` using the new changelog entry as the PR description

10. Ensure .env file is populated with GA and Sentry secrets before packaging (see `./env.example`)

11. Generate a release candidate vsix file with `npm run package`, the vsix file should appear in the `./client` folder with the new version number

12. Manually run smoke tests on the new features across all supported platforms, using contracts from <https://github.com/NomicFoundation/smoke-tests-vscode>:

    - mac os x
    - windows
    - linux (vscode running against docker)

13. On a successful check, `rebase merge` the PR into `main` branch.
14. Switch to main branch and pull the latest changes
15. Git tag the version, `git tag -a v0.x.x -m "v0.x.x"` and push the tag `git push --follow-tags`
16. Publish the language server npm package, `cd ./server && npm publish`
17. Publish the coc extension, `cd ./coc && npm publish --non-interactive`
18. Upload the vsix file to the microsoft marketplace: `npx vsce publish -p $VSCE_TOKEN --packagePath client/hardhat-solidity-0.X.X.vsix`
    - <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/nomicfoundation>
19. Upload the vsix file to openvsx, `npx ovsx publish client/hardhat-solidity-0.X.X.vsix -p $OVSX_TOKEN`
    - <https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/extensions>
20. Create a release on github off of the pushed tag:

    - use the added changelog section as the body of the release
    - upload the vsix file as an asset.
    - append the Nomic is Hiring section to the end of the release note:

    ```markdown
    ---
    > ðŸ’¡ **The Nomic Foundation is hiring! Check [our open positions](https://www.nomic.foundation/jobs).**
    ---
    ```

21. Rebase `development` onto `main`, and force push back to github
22. Update the discord announcements channel

    - link to the release entry on github (i.e. `https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode/releases/tag/v0.x.x`)
    - give a few sentences of description of why users should be excited about this release

23. After 24 hours, to make sure users had time to update to the new release, ensure that metrics are reported correctly to:

    - Google Analytics
    - Sentry
