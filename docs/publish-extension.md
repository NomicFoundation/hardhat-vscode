# Instruction how to publish extension

To publish `ytidilos` you need to do next steps:

1.  Checkout to `ytidilos` [`git checkout ytidilos`]
2.  Merge `main` to `ytidilos` [`git merge main`]
3.  Increase version in `package.json` and push it.
4.  Run `vsce package --yarn` that will generate you `.vsix` file in root of project.\
    Due to the fast releases that `vsce` makes, it is recommended to update the package before running the `4.`\
    `npm install -g vsce`
5.  We can test `.vsix` file by installing it manually in VSCode.\
